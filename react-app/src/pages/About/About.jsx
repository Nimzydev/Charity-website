            <h1>ABOUT THE CHARITY A ELENDA</h1>
            <h2>What makes us who we are</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to empower, upskill,
                and uplift indentified rural communities in London, UK and around the globe.
                We were founded in 2024. This indicates that we want to be inovled in as many communities 
                as possible throughout several nations. We want to work toward this future vision with the 
                communities of Congo.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> We believe that we can help preserve Africa's amazing cultures and ways of life by giving
                communities the tools they need to grow in ways that ensure their welfare in the future. The 
                A Elenda charity supports the implentation of projects that communities identify and invest 
                in long-term relationships with them. In partnership with the government, the community, and other
                interested parties, we make sure that the proper frameworks are in place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>At A Elenda we are a "deep impact" organisation, establishing long-term partnerships and
                relationships with our community partners to support their sustainable development.
